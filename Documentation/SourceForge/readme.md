This directory contains compiled, installable copies of Spim for various operating systems:

  __QtSpim__:

    QtSpim_*_Windows.zip -- Windows (32 or 64 bit)

    QtSpim_*_mac.dmg     -- Mac OS X

    qtspim_*_linux64.deb -- 64 bit Linux debian package

    qtspim_*_linux32.deb -- 32 bit Linux debian package (Obsolete? Does anyone need this?)


  __PCSpim (Obsolete and unmaintained)__:

    PCSpim_*.zip         -- Windows (32 or 64 bit)


Note: * is the version number, e.g. 9.0.1

The code in the repository may be ahead of the latest version. Since Spim is used in classes, I try not to change the install files during the semester, so all students will run the same program. If you want the latest version, go to the repository, download the source, and compile it yourself.
