Notes for building QtSpim on various systems.

All:
        Install the bison parser generator and flex lexer generator, either using Cygwin on Windows or native on Linux.


Windows:
        The Open Source version of Qt Creator for Windows, which uses mingw works fine, as does
        the version (which you need to build yourself) that uses Microsoft Visual Studio's C++
        compiler.

Linux:
        The version of Qt Creator that comes with Ubuntu is an old version, which has some problems with QtSpim.
        Download a recent version from http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/.

Mac:
        Download the Mac Qt SDK at http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/sdk-mac-os-cpp.


Notes:
        If you are porting to a new system, and see a large number of compiler errors in
        QtCreator, changes are good that you need to change QtSpim.pro to define the compiler
        flag that says "treat all files, including .c files, as C++ code. This flag is "-X C++"
        for gcc and "-TP" for the Microsoft compiler.
