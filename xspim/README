The files in this directory are:

README
	This file.

Imakefile
	The input to xmkmf, a standard utility for construction Makefiles
for X windows programs.

Makefile
	Makefile to build xspim on Linux.

buttons.{c,h} windows.{c,h} xspim.{c,h}
	X-windows interface to spim.


xspim compiles and runs on Linux systems (I tried it on Ubuntu 10.04,
Lucid Lynx), but you may need to load additional packages beyond those
delivered as part of the basic distribution. On Ubuntu, I needed to
download and install:

     bison
     flex
     g++-4.4 (any version of g++ should be fine)
     xutils-dev
     libsm-dev
     libxaw7-dev

All are available through Ubuntu's Software Center, and installation
only takes a few minutes.
